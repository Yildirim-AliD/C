## 📂 Projects List  

### 1️⃣ Basic Operations  
📁 **Path:** `01-Basic-Operations/`  
📜 **Description:** A program that takes two integers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus).  

---

### 2️⃣ Circle Calculator
📁 **Path:** `02-Circle-Calculator/`
📜 **Description:** This program calculates the diameter, area, and circumference of a circle based on the given radius. It uses π ≈ 3.14159 and prints the results with two decimal precision.

### 3️⃣ Digit Separator
📂 **Path:** `03-Digit-Separator/`
📜** Description:** This program takes a five-digit number as input and separates each digit with three spaces in between. If the input is not a five-digit number, it prompts the user to enter a valid number.

---

### 4️⃣ Triangle Validator
📂 **Path:** `04-Triangle-Validator/`
📜 **Description:** This program checks whether three given numbers can form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality theorem. If the conditions are met, it prints Yes, a triangle can be formed with these 3 values.", otherwise, it prints "No, a triangle cannot be formed with these values.".

---

### 5️⃣ Average Calculator

📁 **Path:** `05-Average-Calculator/`  
📜 **Description:** This program allows the user to enter numbers continuously and calculates their average. The user is asked whether they want to continue after each input. If the user enters 'Y' or 'y', they can continue; otherwise, the program prints the final average and exits.

---

### 6️⃣ Factorial Calculator
📁 **Path:** `06-Factorial-Calculator/`
📜 **Description:** This program calculates the factorial of a given number.

If the user enters 0 or 1, the factorial is directly 1.
For other positive integers, the program computes the factorial using a loop.The repository contains two versions of the implementation:
factorial_while.c → Uses a while loop.
factorial_for.c → Uses a for loop.

---

### 7️⃣ Multiplication Table
📁 **Path:** `07-Multiplication-Table/`
📜 **Description:** This program generates a multiplication table up to a user-defined range. The user inputs the maximum value, and the program prints a neatly formatted multiplication table.

---
### 8️⃣ Matrix Generator  
📁 **Path:** `matrix-generator/`
📜 **Description: **This program generates different types of matrices based on user input. The user selects a matrix type from the menu and defines its size. The program then prints the corresponding matrix pattern.
